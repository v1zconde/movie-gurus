## User Story

```
Since the pandemic begins, the increase in views and search for movies and shows has increased significantly, we are planning to create a movie app that helps users to manage their tv shows and movies watch list based on their preferences of actors, release dates, genres, etcâ€¦ Also users can create their own watch list to keep tracks of their movies. Functions to for users to check if they already watch the movie.
